   GCM format
=================
The GCM format is the standard gamecube ISO format. It is a raw bit-for-bit dump of the disc, typically provided with a .iso or .gcm file extension.


   Non-GCM ISOs
=================
Some .iso files are not GCM files. Often times they are "NKIT" files, which aren't supported.
